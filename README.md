## Projects

The Codex workspace houses the following projects:

### [Codex](https://github.com/AboutObjectsTraining/Codex/tree/master/Codex)**

Objective-C classes that model a reading list containing a list of books and authors, as well as an object store controller that serializes and deserializes object graphs stored in JSON or plist format.

### [CodexExample](https://github.com/AboutObjectsTraining/Codex/tree/master/CodexExample)**

Subclasses and categories on Foundation, UIKit, Core Data, and Codex classes. Storyboard-based. Depends on the *Codex* project.
